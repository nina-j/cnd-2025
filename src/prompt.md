Given the csv files `locations.csv`, `shapes.csv`, and `sightings.csv`, imagine you have hacked NASA's database and found actual data related to ~50 of these sightings.
Make sure some data is RESTRICTED or CLASSIFIED to give it that hacked database feel.

Create a new csv file `nasa_sightings.csv` with the data.
